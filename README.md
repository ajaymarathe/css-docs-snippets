Make responsive design with help of best css framework and media queries. as per me bootstrap is most popular and best css framework to use for responsive desgin.

### Responsive Media Queries
```
// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

// For mobile device 
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
